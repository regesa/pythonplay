In here, I dump all the scripts that I authored over time I taught python to new programmers

I learnt python between 2004 and 2005. Later, as it gained popularity, it took a centre stage in the dev world and I found myself having to teach it to new developers: hence the need for me to write code snippets that I could use to drive home a number of points.

Feel free to send me any questions by email to egesa@magezi.net
